## Study information

### Background 

This is a project with clear motivation that addresses multiple important theoretical and empirical gaps.
 
### Research questions

Here are the crisply stated research questions that are the focus of our study. We will explicitly link  the psychological and environmental constructs that we aim to investigate and specific ways of operationalizing those constructs. Each of these questions sets up a specific element of our analysis plan below.

1. **Our first question**

2. **Our second question**

3. **Our third question**


### Hypotheses

1. **Here we lay out different concrete possible outcomes that pertain to our first research question above, and state what each outcome would imply.**

2. **We do this again, but for our second question.**

3. **If applicable, we now turn to our third question.**
 
## Design Plan
###   Study type

Is this study employing experimental or observational data?

###  Study design
<!-- describe the overall design of the study (what will be manipulated and/or measured, specify whether manipulations will be between- or within-participants, etc.)-->
 
#### Stimuli 
 
Here is what we will show participants.

#### Task procedure

Here is exactly what participants will see and do, in the order they see and do them. 

####  Manipulated variables
<!-- If applicable, precisely define any variables you plan to manipulate, including the levels and whether the manipulation will be between or within participants. -->

Here are the key variables we will manipulate. 

###   Measured variables

Here are the key variables we will measure.

## Sampling Plan
###   Data collection procedure

Here is how we will recruit human participants.

 
###   Sampling procedure 
The target sample size will be XX and here are the reasons why that choice makes sense.
<!-- indicate your target sample size and why that is your target (might be based in past research, for example) -->
<!-- ###   Stopping rule -->
<!-- specify how you will determine when to stop data collection -->
<!-- Data collection will be stopped after the planned number of participants has been recorded. -->
## Analysis Plan
###  Data exclusion criteria
<!-- How will you determine which data points or samples (if any) to exclude from your analyses? How will outliers be handled? Will you use any awareness or attention check? -->

This is how we will know if something went awry in a particular experimental session such that it would not be sensible to aggregate data from that session with data from the other sessions.

###  Handling missing data

This is what we plan to do if we are missing data.

### Planned analyses

#### SUPER BASIC ANALYSES

Here we describe the simplest sanity-check level analyses we should do to validate our most basic assumptions about what is going on in our study.

#### KEY ANALYSIS 1, 2, 3 

Here we describe each of the key analyses we will use evaluate the core research questions/hypotheses above.
